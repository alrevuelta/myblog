# Bookshelf

This section covers the information I consume, including books, newsletters, and podcasts. I am always eager to learn from diverse perspectives across various fields, my direct messages are open for suggestions.

As a guiding principle for books, I prefer timeless classics over new releases that are SEO-optimized, with catchy titles and flashy covers. In line with the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), books that have been around for 500 years are likely to remain relevant for another 500. Read these first.
