Welcome to my blog. Here you will find my random thoughts, some informal research and interesting stuff. Mostly in English but expect some Spanish.

I'm a telecommunications engineer with a master in signal processing and aeronautics. Have worked in different industries: aeronautics, telecom and finance. Interested in a wide variety of topics: software development and coding, distributed systems and blockchain, aeronautics, electronics, venture capital, economics, game theory and education.

Spanish at heart but called Scandinavia home for a while, Sweden first, Denmark after. Spent some time in Germany. Europe is my home. You can find me as @alrevuelta on Twitter.
